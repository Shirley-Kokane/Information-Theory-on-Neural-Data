# Information-Theory-on-Neural-Data
Here we determine how neurons in the inferior colliculus convey information about two sound localization cues: interaural level differences (ILD) and spectral notches (SN). Specifically, you will investigate how one (representative) neuron encodes the two cues in spike count and assess whether the code is linear or non-linear.
