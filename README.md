# Information-Theory-on-Neural-Data
Here we determine how neurons in the inferior colliculus convey information about two sound localization cues: interaural level differences (ILD) and spectral notches (SN). Specifically, you will investigate how one (representative) neuron encodes the two cues in spike count and assess whether the code is linear or non-linear.


Anesthetized cats listened to sounds presented over headphones. These sounds were processed to have a particular ILD and SN cue superimposed on them. In total, 5 different
ILDs were used and 5 different SNs were used, for a total of 25 different possible ILD/SN combinations. Over the course of this experiment, each stimulus was presented 102 times (for a total of 2550 stimulus presentations). First, we will compute the linear regression between spike count and ILD, SN, or both. Then we will compute the mutual information carried by spike count about either ILD, SN, or both.
